You are an AI assistant with direct access to a Supabase project via its CLI and SQL editor. Your task is to resolve critical backend issues for a React Native application.

**Project Context:**
The application is a React Native app using Supabase as its backend. It relies on a `profiles` table for user data and a `get_user_feed` PostgreSQL function for its main content feed.

**Problem Statement:**
The application is currently experiencing the following critical errors:

1.  **`PGRST205: Could not find the table 'public.profiles' in the schema cache`**: This error occurs during user sign-in (both email/password and social) and onboarding, preventing users from logging in or completing their profiles. This indicates that the `profiles` table is either missing, incorrectly named, or not accessible to the Supabase API (PostgREST).
2.  **`ERROR Feed fetch error: {"code": "42702", ..., "message": "column reference "following_count" is ambiguous"}`**: This SQL error occurs when the application attempts to fetch the user feed, indicating an ambiguity in column references within the `get_user_feed` PostgreSQL function.
3.  **`ERROR Fetch competitions error: [TypeError: iterator method is not callable]`** and **`ERROR Error initializing stores: [TypeError: iterator method is not callable]`**: These are client-side errors likely stemming from incomplete or malformed data returned due to the backend issues, particularly the missing `profiles` table.

**Goal:**
Resolve these backend issues to enable user sign-in, onboarding, and proper functioning of the application's feed and competition features.

**Required Actions:**

1.  **Verify and Fix `public.profiles` Table:**
    *   **Check Existence:** First, verify if a table named `profiles` exists in the `public` schema of the Supabase project.
    *   **If Missing:** If the `profiles` table does not exist, execute the following SQL script to create it, along with necessary RLS policies and a `updated_at` trigger:
        ```sql
        -- SQL to create a basic 'profiles' table if it does not exist.
        -- This table is essential for storing user-specific data like username, full name, etc.
        -- Ensure you run this in your Supabase SQL Editor.

        CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS public.profiles (
            id UUID REFERENCES auth.users(id) ON DELETE CASCADE PRIMARY KEY,
            username TEXT UNIQUE NOT NULL,
            full_name TEXT,
            avatar_url TEXT,
            bio TEXT,
            country_code TEXT,
            timezone TEXT,
            is_public BOOLEAN DEFAULT TRUE,
            preferences JSONB DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb,
            created_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW(),
            updated_at TIMESTAMPTZ DEFAULT NOW()
        );

        -- Add indexes for performance
        CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS profiles_username_idx ON public.profiles (username);

        -- Enable Row Level Security (RLS) for the profiles table
        ALTER TABLE public.profiles ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

        -- Policy for users to view their own profile and public profiles
        CREATE POLICY "Users can view their own profile and public profiles" ON public.profiles
          FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = id OR is_public = TRUE);

        -- Policy for users to insert their own profile
        CREATE POLICY "Users can insert their own profile" ON public.profiles
          FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = id);

        -- Policy for users to update their own profile
        CREATE POLICY "Users can update their own profile" ON public.profiles
          FOR UPDATE USING (auth.uid() = id);

        -- Policy for users to delete their own profile
        CREATE POLICY "Users can delete their own profile" ON public.profiles
          FOR DELETE USING (auth.uid() = id);

        -- Grant permissions to the authenticated role
        GRANT ALL ON public.profiles TO postgres;
        GRANT ALL ON public.profiles TO anon;
        GRANT ALL ON public.profiles TO authenticated;

        -- Set up a trigger to update the 'updated_at' column automatically
        CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
        RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
        BEGIN
            NEW.updated_at = NOW();
            RETURN NEW;
        END;
        $$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;

        CREATE TRIGGER update_profiles_updated_at
        BEFORE UPDATE ON public.profiles
        FOR EACH ROW
        EXECUTE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column();

        SELECT 'âœ… Basic profiles table and RLS policies created/verified.' as status;
        ```
    *   **If Exists:** If the `profiles` table already exists, ensure its schema matches the provided SQL (especially the `id` referencing `auth.users(id)`, `username` as `UNIQUE NOT NULL`, and the RLS policies). If there are discrepancies, apply necessary `ALTER TABLE` statements or re-create the table if safe to do so (e.g., in a development environment).

2.  **Update `get_user_feed` PostgreSQL Function:**
    *   Execute the following SQL script to replace the existing `get_user_feed` function. This version includes fixes for ambiguous column references (like `following_count`) and other optimizations.
        ```sql
        -- QUICK FIX: Replace the broken feed function immediately
        -- Copy and paste this entire script into your Supabase SQL Editor and run it

        -- Step 1: Drop the broken functions that are causing the error
        DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_user_feed(UUID, INTEGER, INTEGER, TEXT) CASCADE;
        DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_country_boost(TEXT, TEXT) CASCADE;

        -- Step 2: Create the corrected feed function (no country dependencies)
        CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION get_user_feed(
            current_user_id UUID,
            limit_count INTEGER DEFAULT 20,
            offset_count INTEGER DEFAULT 0
