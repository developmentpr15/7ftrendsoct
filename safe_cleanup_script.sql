-- SAFE CLEANUP SCRIPT FOR SUPABASE
-- EXECUTE IN SECTIONS AND VERIFY EACH STEP

-- ===================================================================
-- WARNING: This script will drop unused resources.
-- Review the analysis results first and comment out any items you want to keep.
-- ===================================================================

-- Step 1: Clean up unused indexes (safest operation)
SELECT 'üîç Checking unused indexes...' as status;

-- Find and drop unused indexes (commented out for safety - review first)
/*
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS CONCURRENTLY index_name_here;
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS CONCURRENTLY another_index_name_here;
*/

-- Step 2: Remove duplicate or obsolete functions
SELECT 'üßπ Cleaning up duplicate functions...' as status;

-- Remove old feed function versions (if they exist)
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_user_feed_simple(UUID, INTEGER, INTEGER) CASCADE;
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_user_recommendations_simple(UUID, INTEGER) CASCADE;

-- Remove country boost function (no longer used)
DROP FUNCTION IF EXISTS get_country_boost(TEXT, TEXT) CASCADE;

-- Step 3: Clean up old temporary tables that might exist
SELECT 'üóëÔ∏è Cleaning up temporary tables...' as status;

DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_mutual_friends_posts CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_following_posts CASCADE;
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS temp_own_posts CASCADE;

-- Step 4: Remove obsolete triggers if they exist
SELECT '‚öôÔ∏è Cleaning up obsolete triggers...' as status;

DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_profiles_updated_at ON profiles;
DROP TRIGGER IF EXISTS update_updated_at_column ON profiles;

-- Step 5: Optimize table storage (rebuild indexes and update statistics)

-- Analyze tables to update query planner statistics
ANALYZE profiles;
ANALYZE posts;
ANALYZE likes;
ANALYZE comments;

-- Step 6: Clean up old RLS policies that might be duplicated
SELECT 'üîê Cleaning up duplicate RLS policies...' as status;

-- Remove old policies if they exist (these will be recreated if needed)
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view public profiles" ON profiles CASCADE;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can insert their own profile" ON profiles CASCADE;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can update their own profile" ON profiles CASCADE;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can delete their own profile" ON profiles CASCADE;

-- Step 7: VACUUM tables to reclaim space
SELECT 'üßπ Reclaiming disk space...' as status;

-- Note: VACUUM FULL locks tables, so run during maintenance window
-- VACUUM FULL profiles;
-- VACUUM FULL posts;

-- Use regular VACUUM for maintenance (doesn't lock tables)
